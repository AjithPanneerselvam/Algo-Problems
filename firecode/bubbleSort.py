Bubble Sort
Write a function that takes in a list of ints and uses the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort the list 'in place' in ascending order. The method should return the same, in-place sorted list.
Note: Bubble sort is one of the most inefficient ways to sort a large list of integers. Nevertheless, it is an interview favorite.
Bubble sort has a time complexity of O(n2). However, if the sample size is small, bubble sort provides a simple implementation of a classic sorting algorithm.

Examples:
bubble_sort([5, 4, 3]) -> [3, 4, 5]

def bubble_sort(a_list):

    for i in range(len(a_list) - 1):
        for j in range(len(a_list) - 1 - i):
            if (a_list[j] > a_list[j+1]):
                a_list[j], a_list[j+1] = a_list[j+1], a_list[j]

    return a_list
